add a random kb gap for every atk hit ??

burst circle rempli

for future if i want multiple instance for keqing, just do a vector of instances
and getInstance() returns by default the first one. or a selected index.

hitlag (semi ok)

add sound effects

for volumeslider, the ismouseonbutton can be larger, (just change the variable directly)

damaging kb should take into account the weight of the entity

maybe in attacks, add the attack sprite used, and check if the sprite if still animated in theonremove func

isInvincible() for keqing ? and for every living entities in generaL... virtualfunc

for coloring keqing
     FAIRE UN BOUTON POUR CHAQUE COMPARTIMENT
